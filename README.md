# Bridge-To-Prosperity
Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) envisions a world where poverty caused by rural isolation no longer  exists. B2P works with isolated communities to create access to essential healthcare, education,  and economic opportunities by building footbridges over impassable rivers. Since 2001, B2P has  worked with communities in 20 countries to build 318 bridges that collectively provide safe  access to 1.1M people. The project seeks to establish a relationship between the Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) and the Global indicator datasets by combining them to various insights and metrics pertaining to the number of bridges constructed by the organization based on the demographic characteristics.
